# Fallback repairs applied to a filename's title fragment when it can't be found
# in the live API catalog by name. Most of these are mangled non-ASCII
# characters (macrons, umlauts, etc.) that get dropped or garbled during
# filename generation upstream (e.g. "Th_odwyn" -> "Theodwyn").
#
# The "Ring Wall [ringa]" / "Ring Wall [ringb]" entries were previously present
# only in the front-face copy of this dict (the two loops had already drifted).
# Checked against the real archive (ALeP - Fangs in the Dark.English/back_official):
# both "046-1-Ring Wall [ringa]-2o.png" and "047-1-Ring Wall [ringb]-2o.png"
# exist as back images, so the back-face path *can* in principle need these
# fixes too. In practice both files are exactly 1693758 bytes -- a size already
# in GENERIC_BACK_FILE_SIZES below -- so today they get skipped by the
# generic-back dedup check before ever reaching this lookup. Keeping a single
# shared dict (rather than two copies) means that stays true by construction
# instead of by accident, and any future archive where the byte-size shortcut
# doesn't catch them will still resolve correctly.
