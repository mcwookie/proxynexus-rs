"""Take the print screen out of the LotR cards that still carry one.

Most of the collection does not. The Enhanced Proxies, which supply 3,574 of
`lotrlcg-enhanced`'s 3,922 images, were denoised and sharpened before they were
published; so are the ALeP and FFG images, which are digital sources rather than
scans, and the Nightmare remasters. Two groups are left, and they have two
different callers:

  * The 348 images `rename.py` takes from "Lord of the Rings LCG" and "Lord of
    the Rings LCG RAW" -- flatbed scans of the printed cards, screen at 2.4 to
    3.4px. `rename.py` imports this module and calls descreen() and despeckle()
    itself at strength 8, before its JPEG encode. It does not shell out to the
    command line below, and nothing has to be run separately for them.
  * The four cards in `lotrlcg-gap-fills/` taken from lotr.cardgame.tools --
    renders of the offset-printed card, screen at 3.5px across the 1468x2080
    they arrive at. These go through the command line below, by hand, at the
    default strength of 14.

Two strengths because a render's screen is a sharp spike the notch takes out
almost entirely, while a scan's has been broadened by the scanner's optics and
the notch leaves 25-33% of it. More is then left for non-local means to do, and
what is left is no longer periodic -- so the group with the *worse* screen wants
the *lower* strength. README.md argues both numbers.

The screen is worst in the shadows, which is not where a flat-paper measurement
looks. Where the ink is near solid the dots are the paper showing through, so
they are bright against dark and at their highest contrast; on the light card
stock behind the type they are faint. Judge this on a dark area of the art, at
1:1, and beware of judging it on a screenshot that has been scaled to fit --
the scaling beats against the screen and invents a pattern of its own.

Two passes:

  1. A notch on the screen itself. A halftone is periodic, so it stands in the
     spectrum as a few sharp spikes -- here the rosette at 3.53px, at the usual
     15/45/75 degree separation angles, 60 to 176 times its own neighbourhood.
     Picture detail is not periodic and spreads smoothly, so a spike that far
     above its surroundings is screen and almost nothing else, and removing it
     costs the picture almost nothing. This is what does most of the work.
  2. Non-local means, on what the notch leaves. That residue is no longer a
     screen but ordinary grain, which is the case non-local means is actually
     good at, so it needs far less strength here than it would on its own.

Non-local means alone was tried first and is much the worse tool for this. It
averages a pixel from other patches that look like its neighbourhood, and a
regular rosette is the most self-similar thing on the card, so it preserves the
screen rather than removing it: on the renders, even at 20 it left 22% of it,
and by then the art was going flat. The two together leave 2% and hold more
detail than that did. On the scans the gap is wider still -- non-local means at
8 alone leaves 52-72%, against 5.7% for the pair.

The resolution is left alone, on both paths. The Call of Cthulhu pass resamples to MPC's
300dpi cut line, because there the whole collection is built that way and a
screen left in would alias under whatever filter MPC used. Neither holds here:
the rest of lotrlcg sits at about 578dpi, these four arrive at 592dpi, and
downscaling only these to 300 would make them the one set of cards at half
everyone else's resolution. With the screen actually gone, letting MPC resample
costs little -- measured at print size, keeping full resolution and resampling
by lanczos leaves 19% more residual but 9% more detail than downscaling here.
`--long-side` resamples anyway, for a collection built the other way.

The command line takes the corner-infilled folder, not the raw download:
corner_infill_dark.py writes `<input>-infilled` beside its input, and that is
what this reads.

    uv run ../corner_infill/corner_infill_dark.py ~/Downloads/cardgame-tools-lotr
    uv run lotr_despeckle.py ~/Downloads/cardgame-tools-lotr-infilled -o despeckled
    uv run lotr_despeckle.py ~/Downloads/cardgame-tools-lotr-infilled --strength 8  # gentler
